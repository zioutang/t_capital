# Challenge for a cool company

A simple ReactJS project for image gallery and light box rendering.
A demo can be viewed [here](https://mysterious-mesa-57025.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

```
npm install
npm start
```
Then open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

## Notes
I used onChange method on the search bar to deliver the constant search result while user is typing.
The light box also supports keyboard control.
